Hello fellow group members! 

This file is for practice only!

Please update this file with your name, as a way to "check in" that 
you understand how to use GitHub and utilize the git flow.

Place your name here:

1.  Ken Wilkinson (This text has been added after creating a branch)
2.  Ashleigh Hillebrand
3.  Connor Wolfe
4.  Matt Rabe


*** Prior to any code development, please create a branch in your local 
working directory to perform code development ***

Work flow:

1.  Use:
    git branch [branch_name] 

    to create your own, unique branch from the origin master branch.  This will be used to develop
    your own code for different user stories.  

2.   After you finish your code development, use:

    git diff 

    to manually check any differences in your code from the master origin.

3.  If you do not see any major concerns at first, use the command:

    git add .

    to add all your local changes to the staging repository on your computer

4.  The next step is to use:

    git commit -m '[Your message here]'

    to add your file to the main repository

5.  Next, use:

    git pull https://github.com/sanguine-six-dev/create-3d-models

    to check any potential conflicts with future merging by comparing currently developed code
    with the newest version of the repository.

6.  After resolving all possible merge conflicts, use

    git push https://github.com/sanguine-six-dev/create-3d-models [branch_name] 

    to stage a merge request.  You will need to follow the steps provided in the link
    github displays as a return to this request to finalize the merge request.

7.  Your scrum master, Ken Wilkinson, will review all code for potential conflicts.  If there is
    still a conflict, Ken will resolve the issue among the developers whose code is in conflict.

8.  After a new merge is approved, it will be available for review for all people.  Please be sure
    to clearly state what your proposed code will do as clearly as possible in each merge request!
