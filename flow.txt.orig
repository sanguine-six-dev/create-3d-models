Hello fellow group members!

Please update this file with your name, as a way to "check in" that 
you understand how to use GitHub and utilize the git flow.

Place your name here:

1.  Ken Wilkinson (This text has been added after creating a branch)
>>>>>>> checkout

*** Prior to any code development, please create a branch in your local 
working directory to perform code development ***

Work flow:

1.  Use:
    git branch [branch_name] 

    to create your own, unique branch from the origin master branch.  This will be used to develop
    your own code for different user stories.  

2.  After testing your code, use:

    git merge 
    
    to eliminate your branch locally. 
 
3.   After you finish your code development, use:

    git diff 

    to manually check any differences in your code from the master origin.

4.  If you do not see any major concerns at first, use the command:

    git add .

    to add all your local changes to the staging repository on your computer

4.  The next step is to use:

    git commit -m '[Your message here]'

    to add your file to the main repository
